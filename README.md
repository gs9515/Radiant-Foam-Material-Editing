# Radiant-Foam-Material-Editing

This repository extends [Radiant Foam](https://github.com/theialab/radfoam) with new features for material editing and animation visualization. It adds support for interactive **lambertian**, **metallic**, and **dielectric** materials, along with real-time rendering of their effects. It also introduces GPU, CPU, and memory usage tracking - viewable directly in the same UI pane.

To use this extension, simply replace the `src` folder inside the original `radfoam` directory, and rebuild the project following the instructions in the original Radiant Foam README.

Happy exploring!
